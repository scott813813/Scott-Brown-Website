Purpose: Scrub CO2, replenish O2, remove H2O vapor, pressure regulation, work with temperature control system (TCS) and air conditioning (AC), and fire suppression system.

Redundancy for any system at which failure yields a catastrophic hazard. SpaceX triplicates most sensors to insure redundancies and approval beyond NASA design reqs.

Pressure control:

Oxygen and Nitrox system: O2 stored for emergency use. Nitrox (23% O2 77% N2) for a variety of uses, including leak tests. Benefit of Nitrox is that leaks will not result in a hazardous O2 concentration under nominal cabin pressure. 

Regulator operates at extremely low temperature due to adiabatic expansion of gas. Has high pressure O2 compatibility.

Gas temp. management: The lack of gravity fed flow can in some cases cause extremely low temperatures in the tanks near isentropic theoretical limits.

Air revitalization: Air sanitation, dehumidification, and distribution. Fans downstream of sanitation and dehumidification to minimize FOD into fans. Dehumidification is performed by a set of Nafion dehumidifiers which passively filter water vapor which can be expelled from the spacecraft.

Air Cond.: Radiator expels waste heat while in space.
